1,What is Python? List some popular applications of Python in the world of technology.,"Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.","Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language.

2,What are the benefits of using Python language as a tool in the present scenario?,"Object-Oriented Language,High-Level Language,Dynamically Typed language,Extensive support Libraries,Presence of third-party modules,Open source and community development,Portable and Interactive,Portable across Operating systems","Object-Oriented Language,High-Level Language,Dynamically Typed language,Extensive support Libraries,Presence of third-party modules,Open source and community development,Portable and Interactive,Portable across Operating systems"
3,What is the difference between a Mutable datatype and an Immutable data type?,"Mutable data types can be edited i.e., they can change at runtime. Eg List, Dictionary, etc. Immutable data types can not be edited i.e., they can not change at runtime. Eg String, Tuple, etc.","Mutable data types can be edited i.e., they can change at runtime.

4,What is the difference between a Set and Dictionary?,"The set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. A dictionary in Python is an ordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map.","The set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.

5,What is a pass in Python?,"Pass means performing no operation or in other words, it is a placeholder in the compound statement, where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there.","Pass means performing no operation or in other words, it is a placeholder in the compound statement, where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there."
6,Difference between for loop and while loop in Python,"The for Loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection types such as List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary. Developers use a for loop where they have both the conditions start and the end. Whereas, the while loop is the actual looping feature that is used in any other programming language. Programmers use a Python while loop where they just have the end conditions.","The for Loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection types such as List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary.
